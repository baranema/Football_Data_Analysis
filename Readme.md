# Football Dataset Analysis

Project by Emilija B. originally created in **December 2022**. The project was uploaded later because it was previously stored in a different repository.

This is a Jupyter Notebook that contains a football data analysis project. The project is based on the "European Soccer Database" dataset, which contains data on football matches, players, and teams from several European countries between the seasons 2008/2009 and 2015/2016.

## Getting Started

To run this project, you can either download the Jupyter Notebook file or clone the entire repository to your local machine. You will also need to have Python 3 and some libraries installed, including pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and sqlite3.

## Project Description

The project contains several sections that analyze the football dataset using Python and its data analysis libraries. These sections include:

Data Loading and Cleaning: In this section, we load the database and clean the data by removing unnecessary columns and handling missing values.
Exploratory Data Analysis: In this section, we perform exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the data. We analyze the distribution of goals, fouls, and cards, and examine the relationship between various variables.
Team Analysis: In this section, we focus on team-level analysis. We compare the performance of different teams based on various metrics, such as goals scored, home and away records, and win/loss ratios.
Player Analysis: In this section, we perform player-level analysis. We analyze the performance of individual players based on various metrics, such as goals scored, assists, and minutes played.
Clustering Analysis: In this section, we use clustering analysis to group the teams based on their performance.
Conclusion: In this section, we summarize our findings and discuss the insights we gained from the analysis.

## Conclusion

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of the European Soccer Database using Python and its data analysis libraries. The analysis provides valuable insights into the performance of football teams and players and can be useful for sports enthusiasts and researchers.
